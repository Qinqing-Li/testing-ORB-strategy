# üõ†Ô∏è  Opening-Range Breakout (ORB) Trading Bot

*Initial commit  ¬∑  14 July 2025*

<br>

This repository tracks the **full build-out of a Opening-Range Breakout (ORB) bot**. Currently a functional prototype, all classes in classs_sketch.ipynb. 

To run backtesting, you need to register for Alpaca Market API to obtain data. (Data is free to use upon registration. )

<br>

| Module | Highlights |
|--------|------------|
| **Data loader** | 5 yrs of 1-min Apple (AAPL) bars via Alpaca Market API. |
| **Strategy core** | Configurable hyperparameters including opening window, stop-loss/target sizing. |
| **Cost model** | IBKR tiered commission, venue taker fees, NSCC / TAF / SEC levies, 0.01 % slippage, AutoFX ¬±0.03 %. |
| **Back-tester** | minute-loop engine with GBP account, USD settlement, daily mark-to-market. |
<br>


#### Current results (AAPL 2020-2025, ¬£10,000 start)

| Metric             | Gross (no costs) | Net (all costs) |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Sharpe**         | **1.63**         | **-1.04**       |
| **Total return**   | 110 %            | ‚Äì38 %           |
| **Trades**         | 973              | 980             |

> commission + AutoFX dominate P&L at small capital, and the size of capital impact the Sharpe. At ¬£100,000 the same rules yield net Sharpe ‚âà **‚Äì0.29**, at ¬£1,000,000 Sharpe ‚âà **1.02**, At ¬£5,000,000 Sharpe ‚âà **1.11**. (Purely a thought experiment, impossible to have ¬£1M in UK ISA besides the cost model would be different for larger capital.)

Live trading: I'm assuming IBKR TWS API (hence the cost model) for obtaining live data once strategy is ready for paper trading or production.

Testing whether Narrow Range filter (NR7, NR14, NR30) improve the strategy. Short answer: no.

> Narrow Range filters marginally improve win rate and profit factor, but reduce overall expected returns.
